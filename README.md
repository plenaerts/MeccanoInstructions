# Meccano:tm: Instructions
Instructions for Meccano:tm: models which ... don't come with instructions :-)

So, we bought a box which contains a number of images of models you can build with the set. Kids over 10y can probably build most of them based on those images, but for those who prefer to use a step-by-step instruction set, here is a libreoffice presentation containing screenshots from the Meccano:tm: video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVaHNqcVYqg

Meccano:tm: is without a doubt trademarked:tm:. Please respect their intellectual property, brand, etc. This presentation was made just to help my kid ;-)
